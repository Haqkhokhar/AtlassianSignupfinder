# AtlassianSignupfinder
This Python script will find Atlassian signup pages with a status of 200. If they exist, it will show them. You need to add the domain list to the dictionary.

## Misconfiguration:
Almost all companies use Atlassian for their internal service desk, but they often forget to disable the signup pages. This oversight allows attackers to create an account via the signup page and gain unauthorized access.

## NOTE:
The dictionary contains a number of domains, but they should be in the correct format, such as https://abc.com rather than abc.com or abc.

## For Education Purposes
This script is only for educational purposes and should only be used if the organization has a responsible disclosure policy.
